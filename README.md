This source code includes the implementation of our proposal, named **PMP**. 
All traces used in our paper are listed in `trace_list` directory, please see also **Benchmarks** subsection in our paper for downloading these traces.

Everything is implemented on top of a modified version of the [ChampSim](https://github.com/ChampSim/ChampSim) simulator.
